# 📈 Performance Dashboard

## Overview

To better visualize the performance of the SpecBundle draft models, we have built a dashboard to offer interactive experiences to users to explore the evaluation results. We evaluate the performance of SpecBundle draft models under different speculative decoding configurations (i.e. steps, topk, num_draft_tokens) on various benchmarks, the benchmarks include:

- Conversation
    - MTBench
- General Knowledge
    - GPQA
    - FinanceQA
- Math
    - GSM8K
    - Math500
- Coding
    - HumanEval
    - LiveCodeBench
