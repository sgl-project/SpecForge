# Canonical draft objectives

`algorithms/objectives` owns training computation. `build_objective_model` wraps a
canonical draft and an optional frozen target head in one module, so distributed
training executes the entire differentiable computation through its wrapper.
Objectives register independently from model construction and checkpoint formats.
A registration declares supported architectures, input/output names and parameter
prefixes it trains. A trainable parameter outside that coverage fails construction;
explicitly frozen parameters and target bindings are excluded.

The default objectives cover EAGLE3, P-EAGLE, DFlash, DFlash2, DSpark, Domino,
DSpine, MTP and DMTP. They reuse explicit-label CE/L1 loss primitives and functional
sampling/mask construction. EAGLE3 replays its recurrent tree with explicit dense
visibility; it does not add algorithm hooks or mutable KV caches to the backbone.
This is an eager reference path, including dense vocabulary projections; fused
losses, sparse attention and sequence parallel execution are not implemented here.
The legacy training path retains those optimizations and its optional loss variants.

Input batches use **unshifted** `input_ids`, `loss_mask` and teacher features at the
same original sequence positions. Teacher tensors are detached at the boundary.
Auxiliary features are `hidden_states`; final normalized target states are
`target_last_hidden_states`, or callers can supply preprojected `target_logits`.
DMTP additionally requires `mtp_hidden_states` from a frozen MTP provider: state at
anchor A fuses with token A+1, and the objective supervises A+2 onward. Objectives
never run the target or frozen MTP themselves. P-EAGLE additionally needs an
`PEagleSpec.mask_token_id` configuration and currently requires batch size one.

`ObjectiveResult` exposes an additive numerator, denominator and metric ratios.
The trainer must pool these across microbatches and data-parallel ranks. DSpine's
alignment multiplier uses the global backbone CE for the optimizer window; with
accumulation, a graph-free prepass followed by RNG-preserving replay supplies that
multiplier. Its transfer space must be initialized or restored before the first
forward. Domino and DSpine schedules require the resolved total optimizer steps.

## Training entry point

The existing `specforge train -c run.yaml` command accepts an expanded draft
mapping or an ordinary YAML/JSON file. Presets use this same file path; there is
no separate preset selector. The architecture chooses the default objective.
`training.objective` can select another compatible registration, and its settings
are passed through `training.objective_options` (unknown options are errors).
Legacy algorithm switches remain on the legacy route; use objective options on
the canonical route. Nondefault legacy loss/sampling settings are rejected.

```yaml
model:
  target_model_path: /models/target
  torch_dtype: bfloat16

draft: /configs/dflash.yaml

data:
  hidden_states_path: /data/canonical-features

training:
  attention_backend: eager
  objective_options:
    num_anchors: 128
    loss_decay_gamma: 7.0
  max_steps: 1000
  save_interval: 100

output_dir: /output/draft
```

Only one loading path may be selected:

- `draft`: construct a new model with its declared target bindings.
- `initialization.checkpoint`: restore a complete draft through `load_draft`.
- `draft` plus `initialization.weights_from`: pass `checkpoint`, `mapping` and
  `allow_new` to the initialization planner. Optional `initialization.from_target`
  supplies disjoint strict target copies.
- `resume`: restore a training checkpoint through the existing trainer, including
  optimizer, scheduler, RNG and data position. No draft YAML is required. An
  optional draft must equal the saved structure exactly. Training options and
  the original schedule horizon must still match the recorded run contract.

`initialization.adapter` and `initialization.legacy_config` handle explicit
external checkpoint import. `resume` and initialization are mutually exclusive;
none of these fields may mix with legacy `model.draft_*` source fields.

Checkpoints contain the canonical `config.json` alongside the existing
`training_state.pt` and per-rank optimizer/RNG files. The public loader reads only
the draft tensors, while the trainer alone restores training state. Exact resume
checks structure, objective/options, frozen prefixes, target provenance and dtype.
An existing vocabulary mapping is preserved on resume; it is not regenerated from
the dataset. `training.frozen` lists module or parameter paths excluded from
training, and is part of the resume contract.

Canonical records use the tensor names listed above; EAGLE records using legacy
`hidden_state` / `aux_hidden_state` names must be regenerated with the canonical
capture layout or explicitly converted. The generic offline preparation and
server capture adapters now supply unshifted canonical records. DMTP currently
accepts offline records with `mtp_hidden_states`; the generic capture service
cannot produce frozen-MTP features and DMTP streaming fails validation.

The new route supports eager attention and data parallel training, including FSDP
and DDP. Frozen target bindings and the teacher head remain replicated outside
FSDP, matching the existing training backend's frozen-table policy. The canonical
model's requested dtype also controls FSDP computation. Optimized backends and
legacy optional loss variants remain on the legacy route. Online wiring is
validated through capture contracts; a live SGLang capture run is not part of the
current integration tests.
